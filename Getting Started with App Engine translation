**Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine**

**Objectives:**

- Initialize App Engine.
- Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.
- Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.
- Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

**Steps:**

**To initialize App Engine:**

Initialize App Engine app with a project and choose its region on cloud shell:

_gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL\_PROJECT\_ID --region=us-central_

Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello\_world directory:

_git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples_

Navigate to the source directory:

_cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard\_python3/hello\_world_

Run Hello World application locally:

Download and update the packages list:

_sudo apt-get update_

Set up a python virtual environment in which the application will run:

_sudo apt-get install virtualenv -y_

_virtualenv -p python3 venv_

Activate the virtual environment

_source venv/bin/activate_

Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies

_pip install -r requirements.txt_

To run the application:

_python main.py_

**To deploy and run Hello World on App Engine** :

Navigate to the source directory:

_cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard\_python3/hello\_world_

Deploy your Hello World application:

_gcloud app deploy_

If prompted enter y

**To launch your browser to view the app** :

_gcloud app browse_

To disable the application:

_gcloud app versions stop 20200910t100451_

Note: Auto-scaling has to be disabled
